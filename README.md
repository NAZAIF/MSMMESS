# MSMMESS

An Android app created for private community hostel near my Engineering College. 
The surplus/insufficient food became a common problem daily in the hostel due to the students not able to give the daily count for food 3 times a day.

Made a solution through an Android App.

Uses **Firebase Realtime database** to give the count by the members.

## Working

A member of the hostel can register his name and can give the count for breakfast,lunch and dinner.
The mess department prepares food according to the count for the respective times.

## Future Work

Presently, the user has to update the status everyday. In next version, uses a background service to change the status of a user
to default as absent. So, that the status of all users will be changed to default after a particular time everyday.
